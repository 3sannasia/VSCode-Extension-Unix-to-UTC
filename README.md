# unix-to-utc README

Making time conversion easier and lightweight. The main focus for this extension is for people using Python datetime objects but need the reliability of unix epoch time. I want to make reading unix timestamps easier and lessen time-based project headaches.

## Features

1. Replace unix timestamps with the datetime string version

   - "(Replace) Unix Time with Datetime" Command

2. Replace datetime timestamps directly (with or without string quotes) as unix timestamps

   - "(Replace) Datetime with Unix Time" Command

3. Select a unix timestamp and see a copyable datetime message

   - "(Window) Unix Time to Datetime" Command
     ![Unix-to-Datetime](<src/images/Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 8.58.06 PM.png>)

4. Select a Python Datetime string and see a copyable unix message

   - "(Window) Show Datetime to Unix Time
     ![Datetime-to-Unix](<src/images/Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 8.58.27 PM.png>)

## Requirements

Goal is to work on any file

## Extension Settings

### 1.0.0

Initial release of unic-to-utc - Future plan: select unix time text to see datetime in a hover
